How to use custom attributes:
https://answers.unity.com/questions/896763/custom-attributes.html

-> add new custom attributes: SyncVar and SyncPosition
-> unity's Update() will send changed parameters to server, if within bandwidth
-> SyncVar will send changed parameters to all clients
-> SyncPosition does the same, but clients need to use default move functions when syncposition updates to avoid jitter
