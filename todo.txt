Do something like SyncVars:

How to use custom attributes:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/accessing-attributes-by-using-reflection



-> add new custom attributes: SyncVar and SyncPosition
-> SyncVar will send changed parameters to all clients
-> SyncPosition does the same, but clients need to use default move functions when syncposition updates to avoid jitter

- Authentication:
-> authenticate by IP address for now
-> maybe encrypted token system later


- Heartbeat command
-> big timestamp

- small timestamps on update commands (inside data)

Fixes:
- there's a (big) memory leak in strmem (it does not free allocated memory)
 (currently disabled)

Lag compensation: 
->Interpolation
 - clientside, send short timestamp+delta position+avg velocity updates

Max FPS:
 - max out fps at 100

Next up:
 - clock sync and position updates on clientside
 - initial position messaging

Completed/working:
- tcp sockets
- stream compression
- file listing
- var lookup
- basic obj coordination

In progress:
- basic lua interface
- keyvalue interface
- obj lookup
- obj positions
- clock sync




Packet syntax:
Layer0:
[size-byte] [layer1 data]...
255 [size-long] [compressed layer1 data]...
# Todo: change it to size-int for compressed data. we can't support the longs anyway

Layer1:
[cmd-byte][size-2byte][data]...
