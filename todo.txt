Next up:
- object pool
- object rezzing
- objects -> inventory
- make a board that controls weather & time via lua


Questions:
 - when are objects rezzed
 - are objectidentifiers and cnetids unique?
 - how are colliders identified, where are they, etc



Installation:
 - add CNetId to player character and all spawnable objects


Objects:
 dictionary sort by name
 register objects by ids
  - ids should not be included in objectidentifiers list
- iterate through objectidentifiers
 - active in hierarchy only
  - find highest id
  - debug log the ids (inspector? awake?)
- track objects
 - while not immediately necessary, we need to track all object movement on the server and send it with the varinfo for that object












Completed/working:
- tcp sockets
- stream compression
- file listing
- var lookup
- basic obj coordination

In progress:
- basic lua interface
- keyvalue interface
- rigidbody support


Packet syntax:
Layer0:
[size-byte] [layer1 data]...
255 [size-long] [compressed layer1 data]...
# Todo: change it to size-int for compressed data. we can't support the longs anyway

Layer1:
[cmd-byte][size-2byte][data]...
