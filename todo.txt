Do something like SyncVars:

How to use custom attributes:
https://answers.unity.com/questions/896763/custom-attributes.html

-> add new custom attributes: SyncVar and SyncPosition
-> unity's Update() will send changed parameters to server, if within bandwidth
-> SyncVar will send changed parameters to all clients
-> SyncPosition does the same, but clients need to use default move functions when syncposition updates to avoid jitter

- Authentication:
-> authenticate by IP address for now
-> maybe encrypted token system later
-> after getting file list, get files

TcpCompressedStream:
 - compress larger blocks into temporary storage (per user)

- Clientside file i/o:
-> build and store FileTransfer list
-> compare to server file list on endoflist command and build List<FileTransfer>
-> monitor status of file transfers and list
-> write files

- Clock Sync commands
-> server sync to authoritative client
-> other clients sync to server

- Heartbeat command
-> big timestamp

- small timestamps on update commands (inside data)
- objectid as first element of packet, extract and send the rest of data to the obj for object commands

Fixes:
- there's a (big) memory leak in strmem (it does not free allocated memory)
- 

Next up:
- finish transfer missing/modified files when client connects
- how does clock sync work

Completed:

- tcp sockets
- stream compression
- file listing
- basic lua interface
- keyvalue interface
- obj lookup



Packet syntax:
Layer0:
[size-byte] [layer1 data]...
255 [size-long] [compressed layer1 data]...
# Todo: change it to size-int for compressed data. we can't support the longs anyway

Layer1:
[cmd-byte][size-2byte][data]...
